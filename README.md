# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether tweets are about real disasters or not using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset includes tweets labeled as real disaster-related (1) or not (0).

## About the Competition
The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts whether a given tweet pertains to a real disaster.

### **What files do I need?**
You will require the following files:
- `train.csv` - the training dataset
- `test.csv` - the test dataset
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format

### **What should I expect the data format to be?**
Each data sample consists of:
1. **Text**: The tweet content.
2. **Keyword**: A keyword extracted from the tweet (can be blank).
3. **Location**: The geographical location from which the tweet was sent (can also be blank).

### **What am I predicting?**
You need to predict the `target` column:
- `1`: The tweet is about a real disaster.
- `0`: The tweet is not about a real disaster.

## Files
1. **`train.csv`**: The training dataset containing labeled data.
2. **`test.csv`**: The test dataset where predictions will be made.
3. **`sample_submission.csv`**: A sample submission file showing the correct format for your predictions.

## Data Description
### **Columns**
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for each tweet.
- **`text`**: The content of the tweet.
- **`location`**: The location from which the tweet was sent (optional).
- **`keyword`**: A specific keyword extracted from the tweet (optional).
- **`target`**: Present in `train.csv` only, indicating whether the tweet is about a real disaster (`1`) or not (`0`).

## Example Usage
1. Train your NLP model using the data in `train.csv`.
2. Use the trained model to predict the `target` column for the tweets in `test.csv`.
3. Submit your predictions using the format provided in `sample_submission.csv`.

## Notes
- Some `keyword` and `location` fields may be blank. Handle missing data appropriately during preprocessing.
- Focus on text-based feature extraction to improve prediction accuracy.
